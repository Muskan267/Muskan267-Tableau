Tableau will automatically join two datasets if they have a relationship. 
Suppose there are two datasets :

Orders                                                                                   Return

order_ id                                                                                order_id 
name                                                                                     return_date
age                                                                                      Status
address
order_name
cost

If we see these two datasets they share a relationship based on the order_id column.

Step 1: Based on order_id both datasets are automatically joined . Now we can perform any operation on it.
Step 2: We will see the total count for each segment and product ID.
