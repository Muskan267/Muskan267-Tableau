Tableau will automatically joins two dataset if they have a relationship . 
Suppose there are two datasets :

Orders                                                                                   Return

order_ id                                                                                order_id 
name                                                                                     return_date
age                                                                                      Status
address
order_name
cost

If we see these two datasets they share a relationship on the basis of order_id column .
