I had installed Tableau desktop and Tableau public.
Tableau desktop has 14 days free trial and Tableau public is free.

What are drivers? 
These software components allow Tableau to connect to various types of databases. For example, to connect Tableau to a MySQL database, you must install the MySQL driver on your system. Similarly, corresponding drivers are required for connections to other databases like SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL, etc. Tableau provides a list of supported drivers and instructions for installation. 
Some by default drivers are on Tableau's main screen:
TEXT FILE
EXCEL FILE
JSON FILE ETC.
 Still, if you want to explicitly want other drivers you can use: https://www.tableau.com/support/drivers
