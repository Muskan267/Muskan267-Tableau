We can connect to databases from different data sources like Excel, JSON, and many more.


Step 1: connection to the database: Select whatever data source you want to work with in this case we are using Excel
Step 2: After importing the dataset into Tableau: Then select the sheet from the left corner and import the source into the sheet
Step 3: Importing data source into the workbook: The dataset has been imported left side we can see all the columns just to see how it works I clicked the 
                                                   prod_category column to see the total order ( it's kind of seeing the total order value by every product category)

Dimensions and Measures: We  had two types of fields here qualitative known as measures and quantitative fields are  called dimensions 
Convert Measures to Dimension or vice-versa: Suppose according to your use case, the field in measure needs to be converted into dimension or vice versa. 
                                              Then right-click on that field and convert to Measure or Convert to Dimension.
